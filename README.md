# JavaScript Playground

This is my testing playground for learning and practicing JavaScript fundamentals and new concepts. I find it indispensable to have a local coding environment that allows me to try examples quickly with tight feedback loops. 

This playground currently supports:

* LiveReload
* ES2015 support through Babel (including [modules](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-es2015-modules-commonjs/))
* `log()` utility shortcut for `console.log()` (because, seriously, who wants to type out `console.log()` every time?)

## Getting Started

```
$ npm install
```

Run the server:

```
$ gulp
```

Load up your browser at:

http://localhost:8080/
